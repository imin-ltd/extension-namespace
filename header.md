# imin Extension Namespace Vocabulary Terms

This repository holds the [JSON-LD definition](https://ns.imin.co/imin.jsonld) of the imin namespace. The terms in this namespace are defined for use within the [imin Search API](https://docs.imin.co), and are not designed to be used by data publishers. Data publishers should consider publishing thier own extension namespace or using the [OpenActive Beta Namespace](https://www.openactive.io/ns-beta/).

imin works as part of the [OpenActive Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/openactive) to promote the usecases represented by the properties within this namespace, with the intention of standardising them over time.

This namespace MUST be referenced using the URL `"https://imin.co/"` (which will return the [JSON-LD definition](https://ns.imin.co/imin.jsonld) if the `Accept` header contains `application/ld+json`), and is designed to be used in conjunction with the `"https://openactive.io/"` namespace.

Please raise requests for content or issues related to the namespace via [GitHub](https://github.com/imin-ltd/extension-namespace/issues). 

Recommended usage as follows:
```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://openactive.io/",
